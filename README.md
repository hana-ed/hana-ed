## Hello I'm Hana 🌸

## 🌟 About me
- I'm a developer with a strong background in artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering.
- I have also worked on several projects, focusing on Python, R, and SQL to build clean, scalable solutions for data processing, ML, and automation.
- I work across both Linux and Windows (but Linux has my heart 🐧).
- I mostly use VS Code, and I'm comfortable jumping between solo work and agile team settings.

## 🌱 Interests and Hobbies
- Listening to long podcasts on science, tech, culture and history
- Learning languages and exploring new cultures
- Playing video games and slowly learning to build them
